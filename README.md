# Automated-Diabetics-Retinopathy-Detection-System

# Problem Statement

In the realm of diabetic retinopathy detection, despite the presence of numerous systems, there remains a persistent call for innovation. Harnessing the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and contemporary web technologies, the objective is to develop an advanced solution that enhances accessibility to diabetic retinopathy screening. Through the 
creation of an intuitive interface using Streamlit, the aim is to democratize access to sophisticated screening methods, addressing challenges such as complexity, cost, and the scarcity of specialized expertise.
